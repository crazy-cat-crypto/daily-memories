# Daily Memories

An AI-powered personal memory system that captures your daily work, 
thoughts, and learning via email, automatically polishes them with 
Claude AI, and stores them in a searchable GitHub repository.

## Why This?

Most journaling apps require opening another app. Email once, everything else is automatic.
